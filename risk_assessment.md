Osmosis Security makes security easier, especially when it comes to organizational risk assessments. We help businesses achieve mature security postures by analysing risk within existing architectures and making sound recommendations to reduce those risks. We have multiple methodologies at our disposal to assess risk in different environments, depending on your organizational goals and requirements; these include TIK, ISO 27005, and NIST SP 800 30 frameworks. Further, we can implement an organizational risk register that meets your business and technology specifics, which is above and beyond the standard annual risk assessment that all compliance frameworks require.
