### Kat Valentine: Principal Compliance & Security Consultant

<img src="/assets/kat.jpg" style="border:0.25em solid black; float: left; width: 100px; padding: 0.25em; margin-right: 1em; margin-top: 0.5em"/>Getting her start with phones and computers at the early age of 6, Kat decided to put fear of success and failure aside to start Osmosis Security, a boutique security firm that supported her vision of what the professional hacker community should be focused on.

Kat had humble beginnings and started her career working technical support for a local dial-up ISP in 1998. Since then, Kat  worked in many different roles, and is experienced with implementing, testing, and supporting diverse client LAN/WAN environments; deploying a wide array of Cisco hardware and security technologies’ and performing PCI-DSS assessments as a certified Approved Scanning Vendor/Qualified Security Assessor, security researcher, and forensic analyst. She applies that knowledge as a member of Osmosis Security’s Compliance & Security team where she performs risk assessments, gap assessments with compliance frameworks like GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA and PCI, penetration testing, and evaluates infrastructure, applications, and network assets for adherence to security best practices and compliance requirements. 

In her spare time, Kat has designed the first hack/phreak shoeline, [PhreakerSneaker] (https://www.phreakersneaker.com).

Like Kat, Randy started his career at a local dial-up ISP.  He studied Biomedical Engineering at Marquette and spent a couple years as the primary technologist for a rehabilitation research center.  In more recent times, Randy spent a few years as a QSA/PA-QSA focused on emerging payment applications before joining Amazon Web Services to help improve enterprise and startup engagement and satisfaction.

Nowadays, Randy has recently exited an information security startup after a $300M sale and spends most of his time [taking](http://www.wolfteck.com/zm-w0002/) [things](http://www.wolfteck.com/kossel/) [apart](http://www.wolfteck.com/candyhouse/), measuring and documenting [components](http://www.wolfteck.com/2018/04/29/maytronics_diagnostic_2010_2410075lf_rev_01/) and [products](http://www.wolfteck.com/2018/01/27/mini_hifi_bakeoff/), designing cost effective [DIY IoT](http://www.wolfteck.com/orac/) systems, maintaining some Linux [device drivers](https://github.com/cilynx/rtl88x2BU_WiFi_linux_v5.2.4.4_25643.20171212_COEX20171012-5044) and [other FOSS projects](https://github.com/cilynx), and diving into newly enforced compliance standards like GDPR.
