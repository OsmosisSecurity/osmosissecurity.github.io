Social engineering (or people pentesting) is one of the most widely underestimated security attack vectors, and one of the most profitable for attackers. Using both technical (phishing, RFID cloning, USB payloads) and non-technical approaches (shoulder surfing, dumpster diving), we will attempt to compromise your organization through a variety of nefarious means. Our social engineering services can include anything from crafted phishing attacks, custom-code USB drops and in-person deception at your physical location to testing your call center staff over the phone, to give a few examples. In addition to providing you with the details of what we uncovered and potential countermeasures, we can also provide security training for your entire staff thatâ€™s aimed at preventing social engineering attacks.
